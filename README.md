# 🌳 Red-Black Tree Playground 🌳

Welcome to the ultimate **Red-Black Tree Operations** project! This is where trees are balanced, nodes are colored, and algorithms are tested – all for your data-structuring pleasure. 🌈

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a dynamic tool to perform various operations on a Red-Black Tree, the magical self-balancing binary search tree that keeps things efficient and neat! Whether you want to insert a million nodes or just a handful, we've got you covered.

### 🛠️ Features
1. **Insert**: Add a single element to the Red-Black Tree manually.
2. **Bulk Insert**: Insert a bunch of elements in one go – perfect for when you're feeling ambitious.
3. **Delete Single Node**: Got a node that overstayed its welcome? Kick it out!
4. **Delete All Nodes**: Start fresh by removing all nodes from the tree in a snap.
5. **Search**: Find an element in the blink of an eye – or milliseconds, actually.
6. **Inorder Traversal**: Traverse the tree in order and see it all laid out.
7. **Display Tree Structure**: Visualize the Red-Black Tree in all its colorful glory!

## 🚀 How It Works
### **Manual Insertion** (Option 1)
- Choose the number of elements you want to insert.
- Enter the values one by one.
- Watch as the tree grows!


### **Bulk Insertion and Performance Testing** (Option 2)
- Perfect for stress-testing! Insert thousands or even millions of elements and check out how quickly the Red-Black Tree handles the load. ⏱️


## 🏃 Performance
- ⚡ **Quick Insertions**: 100,000 elements added in just 46 milliseconds! The tree grows without slowing down.
- 🚀 **Scalable**: Even with a million nodes, insertion is fast and deletion is efficient.
  
### **Performance Insights**
- With 100,000 elements, the average insertion time complexity is within the expected O(log n). 
- As the size increased to 1 million elements, insertion completed in 507 milliseconds, proving the Red-Black Tree is robust and scalable!

## 🤔 Why Use a Red-Black Tree?
- **Balance is Key**: Red-Black Trees keep operations efficient by ensuring the tree remains balanced after every insertion or deletion.
- **Fast Operations**: Search, insert, and delete operations are performed in O(log n) time, making this tree a go-to choice for time-sensitive applications.

## 🧙‍♂️ Future Enhancements
- Add a GUI to make operations even more visual and interactive.
- Implement additional data structures for comparative analysis.
